<h1>WBGS Algorithms</h1>
<h3>A collaborative project for programming practice</h3>
<p>In order to prepare for A Level Computing, there are two important skills that we can we can work on. This project will seek to develop them simultaneously in a fun way.</p> 
<ul>
<li>Algorithm Knowledge - A wider understanding of the different algorithms out there.</li>
<li>Programming Skills - A programmer is only as versatile as the number of languages he is familiar with.</li>
</ul>
For this reason, I am proposing a project to practice our programming for roughly 20 mins every day until we go back to school:
<ol>
<li>Each person who wishes to participate will choose a programming language, ideally one that they are learning but you can do one you know already. If two people choose the same language, that is fine. I am choosing C.</li>
<li>Each day I will choose an algorithm to implement, and I will produce some C code to implement that algorithm as well as some instructions detailling how the algorithm works.</li>
<li>Then, all other participants will produce a program implementing the same algorithm in their chosen language, if they are not busy (that is to say don't worry if you miss some days).</li>
<li>They can then test their program using some tests which I will publish on the challenge page</li>
<li>And then they can make a pull request to upload their code to the repository, or email me it and I will add it myself if you are not familiar with GitHub.</li>
<li>Anyone who uploads code will then be featured on the repository, and at the end of the project I will choose some of my favourite implementations to highlight in some kind of installation, probably at Open Day. The quality of the code doesn't matter as long as it works, and we will even accept partial solutions.</li>
<li>Don't forget that by participating you will also perceive the inestimable benefit of an improved knowledge of your chosen programming language, and this project could be included on a CV, listed as participation in a collaborative super-curricular project,.</li>
</ol>

Hopefully this will be a fun way to practice programming and learn about some new algorithms that we haven't encountered yet.
The first few algorithms will be something like: (starting easy with some that we know from GCSE)
<ul>
<li>Linear Search</li>
<li>Binary Search</li>
<li>Bubble Sort</li>
<li>Merge Sort</li>
<li>Euclidean Algorithm (for finding the HCF/GCD)</li>
<li>A Level search and sort alg.s such as Insertion sort</li>
</ul>
All of these will be fully documented so don't worry if you don't recognise them.

And then we will do some other interesting and useful ones from Number Theory, Linguistics and Cryptography. 

Any contributions, no matter what language or algorithm are welcome.

If you have any suggestions for algorithms, send me an email and I will add it into the schedule.

If you are interested in participating, it would be helpful if you could edit the participants.txt file with your name and chosen language. You will need a GitHub account to do this.

The project will start next Monday 20th July, as the first day of the holidays. We will try to get in a full 6 weeks of algorithming, which should be great preparation for the start of 6th Form.

But until then, you can familiarise yourself with GitHub using the GitHub Instructions that I have published above, and also with the format of the project using the starter algorithm for this weekend (In the Algorithms Folder). This is an implementation of a divisibilty test for numbers divided by 7.

The practise problem should be a bit of a challenge, but don't worry if you can't manage it, as I will publish a full solution and we will start simply with Linear Search on Monday, which everyone should be able to do. 

NB: If you are an external student who didn't study Python for 2ndary School, this could be a way to get familiar with it, or also to get involved with the programming community at our school.

NB: This might make a good way to practise your JS if you are doing the Code Academy JS as Dr Hedges suggested

NB: If you have missed the start of the project, don't worry. You can join at any stage either by catching up or joining in at the given time.
